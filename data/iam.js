  "IAM-1":["Set ID - IAM (SI) 01612","Definition: This field contains the number that identifies this transaction. For the first occurrence of the segment, the sequence number shall be one, for the second occurrence, the sequence number shall be two, etc"],
  "IAM-2":["Allergen type code (CE) 00204","Definition: This field indicates a general allergy category (drug, food, pollen, etc.). Refer to User-defined Table 0127 - Allergen type for suggested values"],
  "IAM-3":["Allergen code/mnemonic/description (CE) 00205","Definition: This field uniquely identifies a particular allergen. This element may conform to some external, standard coding system (that must be identified), or it may conform to local, largely textual or mnemonic descriptions. If a system maintains allergen codes as it's unique identifier for a particular allergy, and two systems have agreed to process the IAM using update mode, then this field can be used as the unique identifier instead of IAM-8 - Allergy Unique Identifier. This does not preclude using allergen codes for unique identifiers for snapshot processing."],

This element may conform to some external, standard coding system, or it may conform to a local, largely textual or mnemonic descriptions (e.g., convulsions, sneeze, rash, etc.)."],
  "IAM-6":["Allergy action code (CNE) 01551","Definition: This field contains a code defining the status of the record. It allows allergy messages to be sent to delete or update previously sent allergy messages. Refer to HL7 Table 0323 - Action code for suggested values."],
  "IAM-7":["Allergy unique identifier (EI) 01552","Definition: This field contains a value that uniquely identifies a single allergy for a person. It is unique across all segments and messages for a person. If a system maintains allergen codes as a unique identifier for a particular allergy, then this field should not be used. This field is conditionally required. The surrogate field to use is IAM-3 - Allergen Code/Mnemonic/Description, if that field can uniquely identify the allergy on the receiving system."],

  "IAM-10":["Allergen group code/mnemonic/description (CE) 01555","Definition: This field contains the code, mnemonic, or description used to uniquely identify an allergen group when both a detailed allergy (IAM-3) and group level (IAM-11) need to be communicated. In cases where systems want to communicate both a specific drug allergy and the group of drugs to which the specific drug belongs (i.e., Bactrim and Sulfa drugs; Ceclor and Penicillins/Cephalosporins) then the specific drug allergy is sent in IAM-3 and the group level is sent in IAM-11. However, if only a group level is being communicated, then it can be sent in IAM-3 as the primary identifier of the allergy."],

  "IAM-15":["Relationship to patient code (CE) 01560","Definition: This field contains the personal relationship that the person reporting the allergy has to the patient. It uses the same table as that used by NK1-3. Refer to User-defined Table 0063 - Relationship for suggested values. Examples include: brother, sister, mother, father, friend, spouse, etc."],
  "IAM-16":["Alert device code (CE) 01561","Definition: This field describes any type of allergy alert device the patient may be carrying or wearing. Refer to User-defined Table 0437 - Alert device for suggested values."],
