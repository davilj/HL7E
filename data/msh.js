var msh={"MSH-1":["Field Separator (ST) 00001","Definition: This field contains the separator between the segment ID and the first real field, MSH-2-encoding characters. As such it serves as the separator and defines the character to be used as a separator for the rest of the message. Required value is |, (ASCII 124)."],"MSH-2":["Encoding Characters (ST) 00002","Definition: This field contains the four characters in the following order: the component separator, repetition separator, escape character, and subcomponent separator. Required values are ^~\& (ASCII 94, 126, 92, and 38, respectively)."],"MSH-3":["Sending Application (HD) 00003","Definition: This field uniquely identifies the sending application. The value is locally define and often assigned by the IIS in User-defined table 0361. This is not the product, but rather the name of the specific instance. For instance, the IIS in Georgia(GRITS) is an instance based on the Wisconsin IIS (WIR). The code for GRITS would be specific to GRITS."],"MSH-4":["Sending Facility (HD) 00004","Definition: This field identifies the organization responsible for the operations of the sending application. Locally defined codes accommodate local needs. The first component shall be the name space id found in User-defined Table 0362. The second and third components are reserved for use of OIDs. This applies when the message will trigger an “AR” in MSA-1 because the incoming message had one of the following issues: Unsupported message type, Unsupported event code, Unsupported processing ID or Unable to process for reasons unrelated for format or content."],"MSH-5":["Receiving Application (HD) 00005","Definition: This field uniquely identifies the receiving application. This is not the product, but rather the name of the specific instance. For instance, the IIS in Georgia(GRITS) is an instance based on the Wisconsin IIS (WIR). The code for GRITS would be specific to GRITS. Locally defined codes accommodate local needs."],"MSH-6":["Receiving Facility (HD) 00006","Definition: This field identifies the organization responsible for the operations of the receiving application. Locally defined codes will accommodate local needs."],"MSH-7":["Date/Time Of Message (TS_Z) 00007","Definition: This field contains the date/time that the sending system created the message. The degree of precision must be to the second and include time zone."],"MSH-9":["Message Type (MSG) 00009","Definition: This field contains the message type, trigger event, and the message structure ID for the message."],"MSH-10":["Message Control ID (ST) 00010","Definition: This field contains the identifier assigned by the sending application (MSH.3) that uniquely identifies a message instance. This identifier is unique within the scope of the sending facility (MSH.4), sending application (MSH.3), and the YYYYMMDD portion of message date (MSH.7). The receiving system echoes this ID back to the sending system in the Message acknowledgment segment (MSA). The content and format of the data sent in this field is the responsibility of the sender."],"MSH-11":["Processing ID (PT) 00011","Definition: This field is used to decide whether to process the message as defined in HL7 Application (level 7) Processing rules. Reference Table HL7 0103 in Appendix A. The choices are Production, Debugging and Training. In most cases, P or Production should be used."],"MSH-12":["Version ID (VID) 00012","Definition: This field contains the identifier of the version of the HL7 messaging standard used in constructing, interpreting, and validating the message. Only the first component need be populated. Messages conforming to the specifications in this Guide shall indicate that the version is 2.5.1. HL7 Version 2.5.1 Implementation Guide: Immunization Messaging (Release 1.5) 10/1/2014 Page 82"],"MSH-15":["Accept Acknowledgment Type (ID) 00015","Definition: This field identifies the conditions under which accept acknowledgments are required to be returned in response to this message. It is Required for enhanced acknowledgment mode. This Implementation Guide does not support Enhanced acknowledgement mode. Refer to HL7 Table 0155 - Accept/application acknowledgment conditions for valid values. Accept acknowledgement indicates if the message was safely received or not. It does not indicate successful processing. Application acknowledgement indicates the outcome of processing."],"MSH-16":["Application Acknowledgment Type (ID) 00016","Definition: This field contains the conditions under which application acknowledgments are required to be returned in response to this message."],"MSH-17":["Country Code (ID) 00017","Definition: This field contains the country of origin for the message. The values to be used are those of ISO 3166,.24. The ISO 3166 table has three separate forms of the country code: HL7 specifies that the 3-character (alphabetic) form be used for the country code. If this field is not valued, then assume that the code is USA. Refer to HL7 Table 0399 – Country code for the 3-character codes as defined by ISO 3166-1."],"MSH-21":["Message Profile Identifier (EI) 01598","Definition: Sites may use this field to assert adherence to, or reference, a message profile. Message profiles contain detailed explanations of grammar, syntax, and usage for a particular message or set of messages. Chapter 7 describes the query profile for requesting an immunization history. It also includes child profiles that constrain the response to the query."],"MSH-22":["Responsible Sending Organization","Definition: Business organization that originated and is accountable for the content of the message. Currently, MSH provides fields to transmit both sending/receiving applications and facilities (MSH.3 – MSH.6). However, these levels of organization do not necessarily relate to or imply a legal entity such as a business organization. As such, multiple legal entities (organizations) may share a service bureau, with the same application and facility identifiers. Another level of detail is required to delineate the various organizations using the same service bureau."]}DB.data['msh']=msh;
