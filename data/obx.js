var obx={"OBX-1":["Set ID - OBX (SI) 00569","Definition: This field contains the sequence number. The first instance shall be set to 1 and each subsequent instance shall be the next number in sequence. Numbering is not restarted within a message. That is, if a message had 3 order groups and each had 3 OBX, the last OBX in the message would have value of 9 for this field."],"OBX-2":["Value Type (ID) 00570","Definition: This field contains the format of the observation value in OBX. If the value is CE then the result must be a coded entry."],"OBX-3":["Observation Identifier (CE) 00571","Definition: This field contains a unique identifier for the observation. The format is that of the Coded Element (CE)."],"OBX-4":["Observation Sub-ID (ST) 00572","Definition: This field is used to group related observations by setting the value to the same number. For example, recording VIS date and VIS receipt date for a combination vaccination requires 6 OBX segments. One OBX would indicate the vaccine group. It would have a pair of OBX indicating the VIS publication date and the VIS receipt date. These would have the same OBX-4 value to allow them to be linked. The second set of three would have another OBX-4 value common to each of them."],"OBX-5":["Observation Value (varies) 00573","Definition: This field contains the value observed by the observation producer. OBX-2-value type contains the data type for this field according to which observation value is formatted. This field contains the value of OBX-3-observation identifier of the same segment. Depending upon the observation, the data type may be a number (e.g., dose number), a coded answer (e.g., a vaccine), or a date/time (the date/time that the VIS was given to the client/parent). An observation value is always represented as the data type specified in OBX-2-value type of the same segment. Whether numeric or short text, the answer shall be recorded in ASCII text."],"OBX-6":["Units (CE) 00574","Definition: This shall be the units for the value in OBX-5. The value shall be from the UCUM list of units."],"OBX-11":["Observation Result Status (ID) 00579","Definition: This field contains the observation result status. The expected value is F or final."],"OBX-14":["Date/Time of the Observation (TS_NZ) 00582","Definition: Records the time of the observation. It is the physiologically relevant date-time or the closest approximation to that date-time of the observation."],"OBX-17":["Observation Method (CE)","Definition: This optional field can be used to transmit the method or procedure by which an observation was obtained when the sending system wishes to distinguish among one measurement obtained by different methods and the distinction is not implicit in the test ID."]}DB.data['obx']=obx;
